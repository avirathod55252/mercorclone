# Kanban_Clone_Design

## Prerequisites
```sh
* Clone the Figma Design in React. 

* Implement the Kanban functionality which allows users to drag cards between columns. For example, a user might drag the “Research” card from the “To Do” column to the top of the “On Progress” column. 

* Implement responsive design techniques to ensure the application is beautiful and performant on mobile devices. 

* Deploy your React application to a hosting platform like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub pages. 

* Test the deployed application on multiple devices to verify its functionality and responsiveness.
```
### Instructions

```sh
Clone a Figma Design in React.The deployed code should exactly replicate the original Figma design, including fonts, icons, colors, structure, layout, and spacing.  
```
### Grading:

* Only projects that meet all requirements and have deployed links will be evaluated. 

* Projects will be graded on how closely the Figma has been replicated. Discrepancies in spacing, font, etc. will result in a lower grade. Attention to detail is paramount. 

* Projects are only responsible for the frontend code. No backend elements should be implemented.
